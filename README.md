# UFOs

## Overview
### The webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but it would be nice to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we'll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. The dynamic table is created using JavaScript and to enhance the aesthetics of the website we'll be using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Results

### UFO Sigtings Filtered


## Summary
### Drawback
### One main drawback is that the search critera is case sensitive and space sensitive. If you use an upper case or forget a space/add a space you will not get the data returned. 


### Recommendations
### 1. Update the filter options so that it will recognize upper/lower case as well as update it so that it will accept spaces.

### 2. I think another good filter option would be to be able to filter by regions. For example regions in the United States could be: 
#### * Pacific
#### * Frontier
#### * Midwest
#### * South
#### * Northeast
